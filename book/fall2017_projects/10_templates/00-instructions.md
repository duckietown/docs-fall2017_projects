# Instructions for using the template  {status=ready}

1. Make a copy of the template `10_templates` folder and paste it inside `/atoms_85_fall2017_projects`.

2. Rename the folder to the next available integer followed by the short group name. E.g.: `10_templates` becomes `11_first_group_name` for the first group, then `12_second_group_name` for the second, and so forth.

3. Edit the `10-preliminary-design-document-template` file name by substituting `template` with `group-name`

4. Open the preliminary design document and personalize the template to your group.

Note: All groups have got their unique ID number and folders are renamed according to the following table. You are allowed and encouraged to use short names. Please merge from the master. New pull requests conflicting to this table will be rejected.
